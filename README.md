# DAGEE (Directed Acyclic Graph Execution Engine)

Directed Acyclic Graph Execution Engine (DAGEE) is a C++ library that enables
programmers to express computation and data movement, as tasks in a graph
structure, where edges represent task dependencies. Computation can be
[HIP](https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP) kernels
on GPU and C++ functions on CPUs. DAGEE schedules tasks concurrently and
asynchronously, at runtime, as soon as their dependencies are met, i.e., their
preceding tasks finish execution. This is an emerging alternative to conventional
GPU programming with HIP Streams that can lead to better performance due to
improved concurrency, efficiency, and utilization of hardware resources. DAGEE
builds on AMD Researchâ€™s [ATMI](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/atmi) library, 
and uses it for low-level scheduling and hardware management.

## Prerequisites

1. ROCm compatible hardware. See [ROCm Release Page](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm#Hardware-and-Software-Support)
2. ROCm version 3.5 or newer. DAGEE will no longer work with ROCm versions older than 3.5
3. Make sure following packages are installed (in addition to a basic ROCm installation). All these are available from ROCm DEB or RPM repos:

  atmi
  comgr
  hcc
  hip-base
  hip-hcc
  hsa-ext-rocr-dev
  hsa-rocr-dev
  hsakmt-roct
  hsakmt-roct-dev
  rocm-cmake
  rocm-dev
  rocm-device-libs

4. Optional packages

  aomp-amdgpu
  rocminfo
  rocprofiler-dev
  hsa-amd-aqlprofile
  rocm-smi
  rocm-smi-lib64
  rocm-utils

## Building & Running

### Building ATMI
DAGEE builds on top of [ATMI](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/atmi)

Clone ATMI:

```
git clone https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/atmi
```

Create ATMI build directory:

```
cd atmi
mkdir build
cd build

```

Run cmake:

```
cmake ../src
```

Run make:

```
make -j
```


### Building DAGEE

Clone this repository:

```
$ git clone <this-repo's-url>
```

Create a build directory:

```
$ mkdir build 
cd build
```

Run CMake: 

```
$ CXX=/opt/rocm/bin/hipcc cmake -DATMI_ROOT=<full-path-to-atmi-build-dir> ..
```

Now you can compile the benchmarks

```
$ make -j
```

To run the benchmarks: 

```
  ./examples/kiteDagCpu
  ./examples/kiteDagGpu
```

## Source Tree Organization
- `DAGEE-lib`   : the source code for DAGEE library
- `examples`    : some simple example code showing how DAGEE can be used
- `cppUtils`    : helper C++ classes and functions
- `tools`       : various scripts 
- `cmakeUtils`  : cmake utility functions and scripts 
- `doc`         : Source code for doxygen documentation

## Using DAGEE with your project

- Add `DAGEE-lib/include` and `cppUtils/include` to the compiler's include path
- Add ATMI_ROOT/include to the compiler's include path
- Link the executable with ATMI_BUILD/lib/libatmi_runtime.so


## Documentation
We use Doxygen. Run `make doc` in the build directory to generate API documentation and a basic tutorial for DAGEE in `<dagee-build-dir>/html`. 

## Support
This is a research project undergoing development. Please open a Github issue if
you encounter a bug or a problem.
